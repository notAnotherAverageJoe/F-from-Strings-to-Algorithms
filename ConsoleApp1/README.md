F# Learning Project
This is a learning project aimed at exploring and understanding various F# concepts, including basic operations, algorithms, data structures, and more. The project is organized into separate modules for better structure and maintainability.

Project Structure
The project is divided into different folders and files, each containing relevant modules for specific topics. Here's an overview of the folder structure:

bash
Copy
Edit
/src
  /Core
    Core.fs       # Contains basic operations (e.g., add, multiply)
  /Algorithms
    Sorting.fs    # Contains algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort)
  Main.fs         # The main entry point to run the program
Modules
Core.fs: Contains basic operations and utility functions like addition and multiplication.
Sorting.fs: Contains algorithms such as the Bubble Sort implementation.
Main.fs: The entry point for the application where modules are brought in and functions are executed.
